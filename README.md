# 🎓 Education Accessibility & Dropout Risk Analysis

**Predicting student dropout risk & analyzing accessibility gaps using data science, SQL, and Power BI**

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and predicting student dropout risks by analyzing academic performance, socio-economic factors, attendance, accessibility challenges, and school infrastructure.

The goal is to enable education ministries, NGOs, and school administrators to identify at-risk students early, improve resource allocation, and promote equitable education access.

## 🎯 Objectives

✔ Analyze school accessibility & student equity metrics<br />
✔ Build ML models to identify high dropout-risk students<br />
✔ Explore gender, region, and socio-economic disparities<br />
✔ Predict completion likelihood using classification models<br />
✔ Create dashboards to help policymakers take action<br />
✔ Produce SQL-based feature engineering for repeatability
